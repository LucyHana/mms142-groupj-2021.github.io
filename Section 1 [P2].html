        <h2 class="mb-4 anaglyph">Digital Wallet</h2>
        <p> Digital wallets (also known as e-wallets) are softwares, electronic devices, or online services that allow individuals and businesses to make electronic transactions. The product eliminates the need to carry around a physical wallet with banknotes or paper currency. With digital wallets, users can easily and quickly accomplish their payment and transfer transactions and store loyalty information and coupons for later use. This also offers users the option to choose a different method of payment on various websites.</p>
        <p> While digital wallets are popularly known to be in the form of a smartphone app, numerous financial technology companies offer access to the platform on desktop, laptops, and other devices. Users also do not need a bank account to avail for the services of a digital wallet, and as such Digital wallets enable financial inclusion with rural neighborhoods and low-income areas and increase participation in the global financial market.</p>
		<p> The term “digital wallet” should not be used interchangeably with the word “crypto wallet.” While digital wallets and crypto wallets have a nearly similar purpose and feature, they are distinctly different from each other. Crypto wallets contain cryptographic keys that are used to track ownership and transactions.</p> <br>
		  <p> The following are the 3 types of digital wallets: </p>
		  <p style="text-indent: 40px"><u>1. Closed Wallet </u></p>
		  <p style="margin-left: 80px"> A closed wallet is issued by a company that allows a consumer to buy goods and services exclusively from the company.</p>
		  <p style="text-indent: 40px"><u>2. Semi-closed Wallet</u></p>
		  <p style="margin-left: 80px" > A semi-closed wallet allows users to make transactions with listed merchants and stores through online and offline payments. However, the coverage area of these wallets are restricted and transactions can only be made through the wallet. For merchants and stores to be listed, they need to enter into agreements and/or contracts with the issuer of the wallet to accept payments from them.</p>
		  <p style="text-indent: 40px"><u>3. Open Wallet</u></p>
		  <p style="margin-left: 80px"> An open wallet is used directly by a bank or through third party institutes partnered with banks. This type of wallet is similar to a semi-closed wallet, which allows transactions with listed merchants and stores. Additionally, open wallets offer withdrawal of funds from banks and allow transfer of funds, and they also offer users to earn interest depending on the agreement between the service provider and the bank.
