        <h2 class="mb-4 anaglyph">How is it different from debit and credit cards?</h2>
        <p> Advancement in technology gives us faster and more convenient options in life, especially on how we spend, send, and store our money. We've seen in recent years the rise of digital currencies and E-wallets. Before that, and even up to now, debit and credit cards are still being used as alternatives to cash for easy purchases. But what are the differences between these payment methods that make one better or inferior to the other? </p>
        <p> To start, a debit card is a payment card that's directly connected to your bank account where you deposit your money. Every time you use a debit card, the money in your bank account is used up. A credit card is also a payment card, but the money used when you make a purchase with it is loaned from your bank. This loan needs to be paid in full at the end of each monthly billing cycle, or else you will incur interest fees. Lastly, an e-wallet is a cloud-based software application that allows you to make online purchases. But you will need to put money into your digital wallet first before you can use it to spend.</p>
	<p> Before you can use a debit or credit card, you'll need to apply for it first with a bank or credit card company. The application process is more complicated and there are more requirements in opening a bank account or a credit line compared to having an e-wallet. Before allowing to have an account, banking institutions will check on an applicant's financial history for any records of delinquency and for added security. The applicant will also be required to provide proof of billing for verification, and proof of stable income to see if he's able to pay for his credit card bills. It's also costlier to maintain a debit or credit card as there are many fees involved including annual fees, late payment fees, interest charges, minimum balance charges, etc. With e-wallets, it's easier to have one due to fewer requirements and maintenance fees.</p>   
	<p> One of the downsides of e-wallets is that though they can be accessed through various devices like through your desktop, laptop, or smartphone, it requires an internet connection before it can be used. And unlike credit cards, your e-wallet needs to be loaded up with money before you can use it. But more recently, new features were added that allow e-wallets to contain different payment methods. You can connect your e-wallet to your bank accounts, debit cards, credit cards, and even with your cryptocurrency accounts. Having access to various payment options at your fingertips has made online transactions faster, easier, and more convenient. It is also more tempting to buy, encouraged by tons of ads, rewards, and discounts, for payments made online.</p>
